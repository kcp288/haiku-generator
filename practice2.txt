Suppose curb parking is free but all the spaces are occupied, and off-street parking is expensive but immediately available. In this case, you can cruise to find a curb space being vacated by a departing motorist, or pay for off-street parking right away. This paper presents a model of how drivers choose whether to cruise or to pay, and it predicts several results: you are more likely to cruise if curb parking is cheap, off-street parking is expensive, fuel is cheap, you want to park for a long time, you are alone in the car, and you place a low value on saving time. The model also predicts that charging the market price for curb parking—at least equal to the price of adjacent off-street parking—will eliminate cruising. Because the government sets curb parking prices, planners and elected officials strongly influence drivers’ decisions to cruise. The failure to charge market rates for curb parking congests traffic, pollutes the air, wastes fuel, and causes accidents. Between 1927 and 2001, studies of cruising in congested downtowns have found that it took between 3.5 and 14 min to find a curb space, and that between 8 and 74 percent of the traffic was cruising for parking. downtowns have found that it took between 3.5 and 14 min to find a curb space, and that between 8 and 74 percent of the traffic was cruising for parking. cars that are actually going somewhere. Perhaps because cruising is invisible, most transport economists and planners have neglected it as a source of congestion. Nevertheless, a few researchers have attempted to estimate the volume of cruising and the time it takes to find a curb space. They have analyzed videotapes of traffic flows, interviewed drivers who park at the curb, and have themselves cruised. Table 1 shows the results of every study of cruising I have been able to find. Between 8 and 74 percent of the traffic was cruising for parking, and the average time to find a curb space ranged between 3.5 and 14 min. The wide variance in the estimates of cruising surely reflects reality. On most streets most of the time, none of the traffic is cruising, but on some streets some of the time, most of the traffic may be cruising. Are these studies dating back to 1927 only of historical interest? The data were probably not very accurate when they were collected, and the results depend on the time and place where they were collected. The data are selective because researchers study cruising only where they expect to find it. Conditions have also changed since many of the observations were made. Nevertheless, cruising itself has not changed, and the studies at least show that searching for curb parking has wasted time and fuel for many
